# Attack Analysis of Face Recognition Authentication Systems Using Fast Gradient Sign Method
This study was conducted in collaboration with the University of Prishtina (Kosovo) and the University of Oslo (Norway). This implementation is part of the paper entitled "Attack Analysis of Face Recognition Authentication Systems Using Fast Gradient Sign Method", published in the International Journal of Applied Artificial Intelligence by Taylor &amp; Francis.

Note: This implementation derived initially from a bachelor thesis submitted at the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Prishtina "Hasan Prishtina" by Arbena Musa.
